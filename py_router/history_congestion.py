"""History-based negotiated congestion (#590) -- PathFinder-style.

Every soft cost this router already has measures the board's state NOW:
track/stub/BGA proximity price copper that exists, congestion v1/v2 price
density and demand, the ripped-route ghosts price a corridor that was just
vacated -- and vanish again the moment their owner reroutes (the C1 filter in
``routing_context.filter_ripped_ghosts``).

Nothing prices conflict over TIME. That is what PathFinder's history cost is:
a small PERMANENT bump on every cell that participates in a conflict, so
repeatedly-contested ground gets progressively more expensive and later
attempts route around it without anyone arbitrating whom to rip. The 0802
rip-arbitration study concluded exactly this by elimination -- every
frame-local rip gate was refuted, "soft rra pricing beats refusal" -- and
history is the principled version of that finding: per-CELL and cumulative
where the rip ghosts are per-NET and transient.

Conflict events (all in mm-equivalent, composed like every other soft
source). v2 re-targeted the charging after the v1 study (see the #590 issue
thread): the whole-footprint rip stamp was measured NEGATIVE (it prices the
victim's entire corridor -- almost all of it never contested -- and, once the
victim reroutes, permanently prices vacated ground) and the raw-frontier
charge mostly lands on static copper no rip can clear. PathFinder charges
only the OVERUSED nodes; the engine's analog is:

  * a CONTEST (primary, full increment) -- the intersection of a FAILED
    search's blocked frontier with a routed net's copper: ground one net
    holds and another just stalled against. ``analyze_frontier_blocking``
    already computes exactly these cells per blocker (its rip-candidate
    ranking); they are charged there, BEFORE any rip, so a ripped blocker's
    reroute already sees its contested ground priced and relocates instead
    of re-taking it.
  * a RIP's whole footprint (v1, ``KICAD_HISTORY_RIP_WEIGHT``, default 0) --
    kept only for A/B against the v1 behavior.
  * a FAILED search's raw blocked frontier (v1,
    ``KICAD_HISTORY_BLOCKED_WEIGHT``, default 0) -- ditto.

Repeat contests ESCALATE (``KICAD_HISTORY_ESCALATE``): the second charge of
a cell adds max(inc, escalate x accumulated), i.e. at the default 1.0 the
cell's price DOUBLES per repeat (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, ...). A routing call has only
a handful of rip rounds -- a flat increment cannot build a useful gradient in
that many iterations, and ground contested once (the productive-churn BGA
escape regime, 0802 study) stays near-free while ground fought over
repeatedly prices itself out fast.

Scope is ONE routing call: the field is created/reset at batch start and
attached to the config, like congestion v2's bins. No decay (v1) -- decay is
an FPGA-ism for hundred-iteration convergence; a PCB run has a handful of rip
rounds.

PROMOTED TO A SHIPPED DEFAULT (2026-08-13) at the "v1flat_01" settings: cost
0.1, cap 0.5, rip_weight 1.0, blocked_weight 0.25, escalate 0 -- the flat
diffuse field. It was the best arm of every one tested, on three independent
corpora, and on sets 1-10 it recovers ~40 of the ~41-net gap that opened
between v0.20.2 and HEAD while keeping HEAD's DRC advantage (66 vs the
release's 144).

Read the caveat with the result. The win is CONCENTRATED ON CONGESTED BOARDS
and vanishes where there are none: sets 1-10 -47 nets (20W/11L, p=0.075), sets
11-20 +1 (flat, a repeated null), sets 21-27 -15 but with two boards supplying
113% of it (7W/6L, p=0.50). A pre-registered sets 21-27 confirmation did NOT
clear its own thresholds (>=3% AND p<0.05); it was shipped as a default anyway,
on the strength of the congested-corpus recovery. Nothing here reaches p<0.05,
so treat a future corpus result that contradicts it as informative rather than
surprising -- and note two defaults have been reverted on this repo before for
exactly that reason.

`KICAD_HISTORY_COST=0` restores the pre-promotion OFF state for A/B. There is
still no CLI flag and no GUI control: both fronts read these knobs through the
shared engine, so the default reaches them identically and needs no parity
wiring.

Knobs via environment:

  KICAD_HISTORY_COST            mm-equivalent added to each contested cell per
                                conflict event (0 = disabled; SHIPPED 0.1)

                                mm-equivalent (0 = uncapped; a cap keeps

                                converge -- from walling itself off)
  KICAD_HISTORY_ESCALATE        repeat-contest multiplier: re-charging a cell
                                adds max(inc, escalate x accumulated). 1.0
                                (default) doubles per repeat; 0 = flat v1

                                measured negative in the v1 screen)
  KICAD_HISTORY_RADIUS          mm added to the copper half-width when
                                stamping a v1 rip (default 0.25 ~ one
                                clearance)
  KICAD_HISTORY_BLOCKED_WEIGHT  fraction of the increment charged to a failed

                                subset at full weight)
  KICAD_HISTORY_MAX_CELLS       growth guard: past this many cells, each new
