"""
Batch PCB Router using Rust-accelerated A* - Routes single-ended nets sequentially.

For differential pair routing, use route_diff.py instead.

Usage:
    python py_router/route.py input.kicad_pcb output.kicad_pcb --nets "Net-(U2A-*)"

Requires the Rust router module. Build it with:
    python3 build_router.py
(never bare `cargo build` -- build_router.py also places the library and
verifies the version; see CLAUDE.md).

    The output writer copies the input file verbatim, then APPENDS the routing
    results' copper (each result's new segments/vias plus stub layer-swap
    copper). So an original item of a ripped/re-routed net can ship TWICE, or
    next to a replacement, leaving redundant same-net copper stacked on itself.

    Strip an in-scope net's original item when EITHER:

    - it is no longer on the final (frozen committed) board -- the net was
      rerouted away or ripped-and-not-restored. With ``final_ids`` (object
      identity at freeze time) the test is exact; rip/restore preserves object
      identity (restore_net re-adds the saved objects), so a kept original
      always passes. The signature fallback (when ``final_ids`` is None) has a
      TWIN-SHIELDING hole: an original whose net was ripped and re-routed onto
      the byte-identical span is "matched" by the ROUTED twin's signature and
      kept -- and when a later cleanup pass (the cycle prune) removes that
      routed twin, the original ships as copper the board model no longer has
      (neo6502 +3.3V slivers, found by KICAD_BOARD_LEDGER).
    - the writer will RE-EMIT an item for the SAME net at the SAME POSITION: the
      re-emitted item is authoritative, so the verbatim original is the redundant
      copy (this covers a byte-identical replacement, which a full-signature match
      alone treats as "kept").

    ``full_sig`` distinguishes a superseded item from a kept one; ``pos_sig`` is
    the coarser locus a replacement lands on (via drill hole / segment span).

    Route single-ended nets using the Rust router.

    For differential pair routing, use route_diff.py instead.

    Every run ends with the in-run PLANE FINALIZE (#562, gate
    KICAD_PLANE_FINALIZE=1 default ON): for zone nets in this run's net
    scope it runs the repair engine (taps + region joins; rip authority
    gated by KICAD_FINALIZE_RIP=1, default ON), the shared
    cleanup pipeline, and the kicad-cli oracle verify, then folds stubborn
    oracle links into the final reconciliation as custody. The standalone
    repair step no longer exists in the chain; a pour is only welded by a
    route step whose --nets cover the plane nets.

    Args:
        input_file: Path to input KiCad PCB file
        output_file: Path to output KiCad PCB file
        net_names: List of net names to route
        layers: List of copper layers to route on (must be specified - cannot auto-detect
                which layers are ground planes vs signal layers)
        bga_exclusion_zones: Optional list of BGA exclusion zones (auto-detected if None)
        direction_order: Direction search order - "forward" or "backward"
                        (None = use GridRouteConfig default)
        ordering_strategy: Net ordering strategy:
            - "mps": Use Maximum Planar Subset algorithm to minimize crossing conflicts (default)
            - "inside_out": Sort BGA nets by distance from BGA center
            - "original": Keep nets in original order
        track_width: Track width in mm (default: defaults.TRACK_WIDTH, 0.3)
        track_width_from_class: True = the width was NOT explicitly set by the
            operator (--track-width omitted / GUI override unchecked). Without
            impedance, each net then routes at its OWN netclass width (#435);
            with impedance, solved widths floor at the fab tier instead of
            track_width (#610).
        clearance: Clearance between tracks in mm (default: defaults.CLEARANCE, 0.25)
        via_size: Via outer diameter in mm (default: defaults.VIA_SIZE, 0.5)
        via_drill: Via drill size in mm (default: defaults.VIA_DRILL, 0.3)
        grid_step: Grid resolution in mm (default: 0.1)
        via_cost: Penalty for placing a via in 0.1mm grid steps (default: 50 = 5mm; mm-equivalent at any grid_step)
        max_iterations: Max A* iterations before giving up (default: 200000)
        heuristic_weight: A* heuristic weight, higher=faster but less optimal (default: routing_defaults.HEURISTIC_WEIGHT)
        stub_proximity_radius: Radius around stubs to penalize in mm (default: 2.0)
        stub_proximity_cost: Cost penalty near stubs in mm equivalent (default: 0.2)
        bga_proximity_radius: Radius around BGA edges to penalize in mm (default: 7.0)
        bga_proximity_cost: Cost penalty near BGA edges in mm equivalent (default: 0.2)
        debug_lines: Output debug geometry on User.3 (connectors), User.4
                     (stub dirs), User.8 (simplified), User.9 (raw A*)
        minimal_obstacle_cache: If True, only build obstacle cache for nets being routed
                               (faster when re-routing a small number of nets)
        cancel_check: Optional callable returning True if routing should be cancelled
        progress_callback: Optional callable(current, total, net_name) for progress updates
        return_results: If True, return results data instead of writing to file
        stage_board_fn: Optional zero-arg callable returning a path to a staged
            copy of the CURRENT board (the GUI passes a live-board saver). The
            in-run plane finalize's kicad-cli oracle runs on this file instead of

    # Never ship a board this run made WORSE. route.py may rip already-routed
    # copper from two entry points -- the in-run finalize/reconciliation
    # (clearing a blocker, placing a plane tap) and --rip-existing-nets retry
    # rounds -- and a rip whose restore is refused leaves that net broken. The
    # damage was reported honestly and the board written anyway: in the
    # sets-21-27 wave that was the largest single source of lost connectivity,
    # bigger than routing failure (bms_sensor turned a 3-pad problem into a
    # 20-pad one; spartan6_4layer lost 20 nets all of their copper). Detection
    # was never the missing half -- ROLLBACK was.
    #
    # It runs HERE, at the very end, on the WRITTEN file: that is the run's
    # true final artifact, after the finalize AND every reconciliation lap, so
    # one check covers both rip entry points instead of chasing each. It is
    # also why this is not a route.py main() post-pass -- inside batch_route
    # it is on the shared engine path, and the verdict reaches the GUI too.
    #
    # BOTH fronts measure AND revert, by the same verdict. The two reverts are
    # spelled differently only because the artifact is: the file front rewrites
    # the output as the input board, and the GUI front returns an EMPTY
    # change-set. No pcbnew surgery is involved on either -- the GUI applier
    # runs AFTER batch_route returns, so withholding the change-set is a true
    # rollback, not an un-apply.
    #
    # Only the run that OWNS the artifact gates. Every nested batch_route --
    # the reconciliation sub-run, the plane finalize's reconnects -- carries
    # final_reconcile=False, and a nested verdict is both meaningless (it
    # measures one slice of the board) and actively misleading (it would print
    # a REVERT notice for a sub-run whose caller is still working). The CLI
    # sub-run is additionally in-place (input == output), which the file branch
    # excludes anyway; the GUI sub-run is not, which is how this surfaced.
    #
    # A board with no input copper cannot regress -- there is nothing yet to
    # break -- so the first (and usually largest) route step of a chain pays
    # nothing for the gate, and only the later steps, which are exactly where
    # the rips live, are measured.
