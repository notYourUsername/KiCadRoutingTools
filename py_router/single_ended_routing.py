    Escalation rung (PR #535's idea): when no in-pad via fits -- or #581's
    same-net pad via clearance forbids via-in-pad entirely -- search
    KICAD_ESCAPE_STUB_RADIUS mm (default 1.0; 0 disables) around the pad for
    the first spot where a through-via is legal on every layer and inject a
    pad->via escape stub. Same tap machinery, nonzero search radius: the tap
    routes the pad->via trace at fine grid / capped clearance, and its via map
    honors #581 automatically (the off-pad via keeps the required distance
    from same-net pads while the TRACE may leave the pad).

    Uses the dedicated local via-obstacle map at EXACT clearance (the ae2069
    plane-tap machinery), NOT the big routing grid, which carries an extra search
    margin and over-blocks a via that is actually fab-legal. Escalates the via
    down the fab floors (deduped by diameter -- the dimension that decides the
    fit) so a tighter pad still gets the largest via that fits. Failures are
    memoised per (net, pad) on pcb_data so a genuinely-boxed pad pays the
    (windowed) board scan at most once per run instead of every reroute pass.

    """#544/#562 POUR-LAUNCH ladder v3: per-REGION fill launch cells.

    Every pad-covered fill REGION of this net's zones contributes laddered
    launch cells keyed to the component its covered pads belong to. The
    fill-aware grouping (check_net_connectivity) already unioned those pads
    with their region, so the keying is exact -- no majority vote, no
    cross-region credit: attaching to a region unions you with THAT
    region's component only, and the MST plans the region's own join edge.

    Regions covering NO terminal follow the zone's own island policy:
    under island_removal_mode 0 (KiCad's default, remove isolated) they
    are phantom copper -- never a node, never attach surface. Modes 1/2
    keep them at fill time; their pseudo-terminal nodehood is deferred
    (counted + noted, not offered).

    Per straggler, expanding rungs (1/2.5/6/15 mm); candidates = the
    region's fill cells scored dist + fragility (strait/boundary attach
    pays up to _FRAG_MM; fill deeper than _DEEP_MM is free) plus, when
    KICAD_POUR_LAUNCH_COPPER=1, the owning component's existing copper
    cells (no fragility penalty); first rung with any candidate wins,
    best _NBEST kept.

    Returns {component_id: {(gx, gy, layer_idx): (fx, fy)}} for the caller
    to merge into its island-cell map (Phase 1's _island_cells AND Phase
    3's _p3_island_cells -- v2 only fed Phase 1, so the straggler edges
    Phase 3 routes never saw fill targets at all). Default ON;
    KICAD_POUR_LAUNCH=0 disables; {} when off or unavailable.

    Route only the main (longest MST segment) connection of a multi-point net.

    This is Phase 1 of multi-point routing. It computes an MST between all pads
    and routes the longest segment first, creating a clean 2-point route
    suitable for length matching.

    After length matching is applied, call route_multipoint_taps() to
    complete the remaining connections using the remaining MST edges.

    Args:
        pcb_data: PCB data
        net_id: Net ID to route
        config: Grid routing configuration
        obstacles: Pre-built obstacle map
        pad_info: List of (gx, gy, layer_idx, orig_x, orig_y, pad) from get_multipoint_net_pads()
        attraction_path: Optional bus-corridor centerline (grid coords). The
            main edge is chosen to SPAN it (see _select_multipoint_main_edge)
            and the router attracts toward it, exactly as in
            route_net_with_obstacles -- multipoint bus members used to route
            their main edge blind.

    Returns:
        Routing result dict with:
